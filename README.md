# Eeensy Weensy ETL

This is getting to know Azure - a database, a serverless function, some Terraform, and (if things go well) some Java microservice API endpoints. In AWS this is very straight-forward for me because that is 100% my infrastructure experience. I'm seeing more and more companies requiring Azure experience so, this way, at least I can say I've touched it.

Did some research on Github Events API and created a Github auth token. Added the bones of Terraform code for a Azure serverless Java function.

Finished the Terraform for the database and applied this. I have a SQL database in Azure!
